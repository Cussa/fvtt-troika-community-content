In the distance a whistle sounds. 1d6 rounds later, the engine rolls to a screeching halt steps away from where the spell was cast, leaving a permanent set of tracks in its wake. Anything unfortunate enough to be hit by the train is destroyed. The engine will start falling apart almost immediately upon its arrival, but can be used to travel 2d6x10 miles before the boiler explodes horribly.</p>",
