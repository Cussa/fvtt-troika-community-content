    "special": "<p>As a being from a whole different level of the multiverse, your sense of self while existing on</p><p>this plane is… mutable. A fact that can both play to your advantage and disadvantage at</p><p>times. Whenever you receive a shock, be that physical damage of one sort or another, a</p><p>sudden onset of strong emotions… or a particularly large sneeze. You **must roll immediately</p><p>on the **Change! chart below, and transform accordingly.</p><p>You may also initiate a **Change! Roll yourself as an Action, at a cost of 3 stamina, and may</p><p>modify the result of the roll by up to your level in the Advanced Skill, higher or lower.</p><p>You may be under several **Change! effects at once, and can remove *one old effect when you</p><p>initiate a roll yourself but *not when the roll is due to any other cause.</p><p>##Roll on 2d6\t\t**Change! Transformation</p><p>- 2\t\tYou vanish back to your own plane of existence, returning to the exact spot in</p><p>an hour with no knowledge of what has transpired in the meantime.</p><p>- 3\t\tGravity suddenly changes for you, roll a 1d3 with 1 being ‘forward’, 2 being</p><p>‘backward’ or 3 being ‘up’ in relation to your current thinking. That way is now</p><p>‘down’ for you.</p><p>- 4\t\tYou are now a liquid. You still have some control over your movement, but will</p><p>always flow downwards if on any sloping gradient. You cannot hold or wear anything.</p><p>- 5\t\tYou are now a gas. You can keep yourself from diffusing too much and can even move</p><p>freely in still air, but will be blown along by any breeze or wind. You cannot hold</p><p>or wear anything.</p><p>- 6\t\tYou are suddenly affected by the ‘Diminish’ spell, shrinking to half your current size.</p><p>- 7\t\tYou take on the form of the last non-sentient creature you can remember seeing. You</p><p>have all the skills, attacks and natural abilities of said creature but retain your own</p><p>stamina. Your GM can always decide if a creature is off-limits for this effect and</p><p>instead choose another.</p><p>- 8\t\tYou are suddenly affected by the ‘Grow’ spell, growing to double your current size.</p><p>- 9\t\tYou take on the form of the last sentient being you looked at, or are currently looking</p><p>at. You can replicate their clothes and accessories, their voice and even mannerisms.</p><p>However you do not have their skills, abilities or knowledge.</p><p>- 10\t\tGravity suddenly has no effect on you. You may fly freely in any direction with just a</p><p>thought. This effect lasts only until you next roll on this chart, whatever the cause of</p><p>said roll. GM’s may provide inopportune sneezes at their whim.</p><p>- 11\t\tThere are now (+1) of you. Cut your current maximum stamina in half. That is the maximum</p><p>stamina any of you can have while the other exists. Add 1 extra token to the combat stack,</p><p>you may move or act with any of your bodies when one of your tokens is drawn. If you</p><p>voluntarily remove this effect, double your maximum stamina. You are fairly certain you’re</p><p>still the original.</p><p>- 12\t\tFor just a moment… you are freed from the passage of time itself. You may step backwards or</p><p>forwards to any point in the last or next hour, arriving at the place your ‘self’ in that</p><p>moment was/will be, but with/without any extra knowledge you would have gained in that</p><p>interim. If this roll was a result of damage, you may choose to jump back just that second</p><p>and completely avoid said damage.</p>",
    "notes": "<p>'There are more worlds than these.' Is a common phrase across all the multitude of opened</p><p>spheres, thronging with multiversal travellers. Perhaps in an attempt to stave off the</p><p>inevitable disappointment of how shallow infinity can seem at times. Many who trek out</p><p>across the madness of it all are often searching for themselves, after all; and can become</p><p>quite frustrated when throughout literally limitless possibilities… they still cannot find it.</p><p>How cheering for them, then… to meet a visitor from somewhere wholly separate. From a plane</p><p>several steps above or below even the wisest mind's scope. Someone to whom 3-dimensional</p><p>space and time that only goes forward are frightfully novel concepts.</p><p>You left your intangible, indescribable dimension against all better advice. Taking on a</p><p>shape and form you certainly hoped would be inconspicuous among all these strange, lumpen</p><p>creatures and their ‘laws’ of physics and geometry. It is endlessly fascinating, to lumber</p><p>amongst them… trying to remember which way counts as ‘up’ and what ‘breathing’ is for.</p>",
